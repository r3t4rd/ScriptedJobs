scriptedjobs.lua
===

An extremely simple and pretty useful script if your jobs.lua counts more than 2000 lines.

**Features**

- Single file
- Very flexible code
- Quick and easy organization creation
- Supports creating your own tables and variables
- Automatically creates a category for the table if one is missing or not in use
- Job Stats customisation and scaling per rank

Example
---

```lua
local gangsters = {
	name = "Gangsters",
	command = "GANGSTA",
	color = Color(255,0,0,255),
	models = {
		{"models/Humans/Group03/Male_01.mdl","models/Humans/Group03/male_06.mdl"},
		"models/gman_high.mdl"
	},
	weapons = {
		weapon_glock,
		weapon_ak47
	},
	ranks = {
		"Newbie", "Active", "Raider", "Leader"
	},
	category = "Gang",
	stats = {
		50, 50, 50, 50
	},
	sa = 100
}
createJobs(gangsters)
```

Documentation

That looks pretty heavy and not really understandable. Let's take a look how the fuck is works:

### Table

##### local gangsters = {}

Creates new organisation.
You able to call it however you want and feel free to create them for any type of jobs you want. 

We're creating our new organization. Feel free to call it however you want. You can create them for any type of jobs.

### Keys

##### name = "string"

Set the individual name for organization. Shows in scoreboard.

##### command = "string"

Set the individual command for organization. **Must be unique** for each organization.

##### color = Color(r,b,a,alpha)

Set color for organization. Shows in scoreboard and chat.

##### models = {}

Organization's models list. If you're using *unique* key, then feel free to create new table for each rank like this:
```lua
	models = {
		{'fake/path/model1.mdl', 'fake/path/model2.mdl', 'fake/path/model3.mdl'}, -- for rank1
		{'fake/path/model4.mdl', 'fake/path/model5.mdl'} -- for rank2
		'fake/path/model1.mdl' -- for rank3
	}
	ranks = {
		"rank1", -- using model1.mdl, model2.mdl and model3.mdl
		"rank2", -- using model4.mdl, model5.mdl
		"rank3" -- just model1.mdl
	}
```

If not, then:
```lua
	models = {
		'fake/path/model1.mdl',
		'fake/path/model2.mdl',
		'fake/path/model3.mdl'
	}
	ranks = {
		"rank1",
		"rank2", -- they're using all models from models table
		"rank3"
	}
```

##### weapons = {}

Weapon list. Works same as models for *unique* key.
Doesn't work with weapon names or other customs strings. Use only weapon class, please.
**tip:** ##### LocalPlayer():GetActiveWeapon():GetClass()

##### ranks = {}

Organization ranks. Sort them from lowest rank to highest, elsewhere whole hierarchy will fuck up.

##### category = {}

##### stats = {}

##### sa = num

Salary multiplier. Will increase salary for each rank:
```lua
	ranks = { "rank1", "rank2", "rank3"	},
	sa = 100
```
Will result:
```lua
	rank1 = DefaultSalary + 100
	rank2 = DefaultSalary + 200
	Rank3 = DefaultSalary + 300
```

Increases via **salary** = *defaultSalary + (organization.salary * ogranization.ranks[number])*
